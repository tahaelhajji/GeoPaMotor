# FI1ps_PMSM:
This motor is a V-Shaped Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor. This is the most used motor topology in the automotive industry. This motor topology is geometrically parametrized for one layer V-shaped magnets.

## :computer: Demo:
A online demonstration of the V-shaped PMSM will be available soon on:
