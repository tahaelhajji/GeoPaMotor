# V_1Lay_PMSM:
This motor is a V-Shaped Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor. This is the most used motor topology in the automotive industry. This motor topology is geometrically parametrized for one layer V-shaped magnets.

## :bug: Fixing bugs:
If you encountered any bugs with the GeoPaMotor tool, contact me an email specifying the bug and the concerned motor: taha.elhajji@gmail.com.

## Demo:
A online demonstration of the V-shaped PMSM will be available soon on Google Collab

## Resources:
This tool can be used for optimization purposes. An application of this tool can be found in our published article:
