# GeoPaMotor: Geometric Parametrization of Motors

This repository is dedicated to the geometrizatic parametrization of various topologies of electric motors mostly used in electric transports. This parametrization is useful for the optimization process in which it is required to generate multiple feasible geometries using robust geometric design. This parametrization relies on a fine mathematical design of the motor geometry. This repository will list the parametrization of the most used motors used in the automotive industry.

## :scroll: List of Motors:

- ### V_1Lay_PMSM:
This motor is a V-Shaped Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor. This is the most used motor topology in the automotive industry. This motor topology is geometrically parametrized for one layer V-shaped magnets.

- ### F_Ins_1Lay_PMSM:
This is an internal Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor. This motor topology is geometrically parametrized for one layer flat inserted magnets.

- ### F_Ins_1Lay_ps_PMSM:
This is an internal Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor with pole shape. This motor topology is geometrically parametrized for one layer flat inserted magnets with pole shape on the rotor periphery.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Instructions for the GeoPaMotor Tool
The GeoPaMotor can be used and integrated in your design tool. As this repository is composed of various contributions, each motor specifies the instructions on how to use it to and connect it with your research work.

## :bug: Fixing bugs:
If you encountered any bugs with the GeoPaMotor tool, contact me an email specifying the bug and the concerned motor: taha.elhajji@gmail.com.

## :mag_right: Looking for a specific motor topology?
If you would like to parametrize the geometry of a motor topology (not among the listed motor topologies above), whether for a public research work or private research work (not to be included in this repository), send me an inquiry by email taha.elhajji@gmail.com. Based on my experience, I can design the motor geometries using robust and complex mathematical equations.
